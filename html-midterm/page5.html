    <h1>List of Changes</h1>
    <h2>Page 1</h2>
    <p>
    - changed nav bar to include page5 and link to other pages correctly <br>
    - line 24: added li closing argument<br>
    - line 36: added td closing argument<br>
    - line 30: added p closing argument<br>
    - line 27: added image source path <br>
    - line 42/43: added tr and table closing arguments<br>
    - added correct header (all my lines are off in this comment because I did it last)<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Page 2</h2>
    <p>
    - added end tag to bold New Beehive Inn <br>
    - changed all the â€™ to ' because my editor didn't like it <br>
    - in nav bar added ../ to be able to move between pages <br>
    - moved bold tag inside h2 element because h2 cannot be a descendant of the bold tag <br>
    - changed broken link and "where do I go" to the correct Wiki links <br>
    - the headers numbers were crazy so I made them in order so the bolding on the page would be accurate and for good HTML practice <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Page 3</h2>
    <p>
    - added a title, meta, and a link to a css stylesheet found in the css subfolder.<br>
    - changed footer position from absolute to relative to keep at bottom of page <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Page 4</h2>
    <p>
    - added alt for each img <br>
    - line 41 added closing tag <br>
    - line 46 added table data tags  <br>
    - line 53 added table data opening tag <br>
    - the table titles don't line up with the images, 
        so I'm going to move the images around so that there is a 
        dog column, cat column, and other column. Before they were in rows, but the headers were showing columns <br>
