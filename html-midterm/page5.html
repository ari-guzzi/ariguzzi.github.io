    <h1>List of Changes</h1>
    <h2>Page 1</h2>
    <p>
    - wrote ! + enter to add necessary components of html file <br>
    - made sure a closing HTML tag is at end of code <br>
    - moved head to be around style and below the language element <br>
    - deleted the Week 3 Assignment title because the page had two titles <br>
    - changed the closing tag around crème fraiche to make only that word italicized <br>
    - changed all the ’ to ' because my editor didn't like it <br>
    - in nav bar added ../ to be able to move between pages <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Page 2</h2>
    <p>
    - added end tag to bold New Beehive Inn <br>
    - changed all the ’ to ' because my editor didn't like it <br>
    - in nav bar added ../ to be able to move between pages <br>
    - moved bold tag inside h2 element because h2 cannot be a descendant of the bold tag <br>
    - changed broken link and "where do I go" to the correct Wiki links <br>
    - the headers numbers were crazy so I made them in order so the bolding on the page would be accurate and for good HTML practice <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Page 3</h2>
    <p>
    - changed the tag l to li in line 51 <br>
    - fixed closing tag line 80 <br>
    - moved Lily from Line 84 to 86 to make the table look right <br>
    - moved 22 from 97 to 94 to make the table look right <br>
    - moved Axelia from 102 to 105 to make the table look right <br>
    - changed Zapata from having table header tags to the table data tag line 86 so that it was uniform <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Page 4</h2>
    <p>
    - added alt for each img <br>
    - line 41 added closing tag <br>
    - line 46 added table data tags  <br>
    - line 53 added table data opening tag <br>
    - the table titles don't line up with the images, 
        so I'm going to move the images around so that there is a 
        dog column, cat column, and other column. Now they're in rows <br>
