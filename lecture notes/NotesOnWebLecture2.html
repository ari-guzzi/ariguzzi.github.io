<strong>files</strong> = units of info stored on computer, files take the form many different formats, 
denoted by their file extension

<strong>file extension</strong> = define the type of file. in this class mostly .css, .js, and .html

<strong>directory</strong> = a collection of files, aka folder. a github repo is an example of a directory

a directory can have <strong>subdirectories</strong>, or directories within directories (folders within folders). a 
directory containing other directories called a  <strong>parent directory</strong> 

<strong>path</strong> = unique address of item on your computer

<strong>absolute links</strong> are the full address of the file, use often for external links from our website to other
websites

<strong>relative links</strong> are paths that are shorter, adn depend on path the file linking to, encouraged
to use relative links when possible
    - 3 types:
        - 1. linked page is in same place - equal levels, just name file
        - 2. linked page is in parent directory - move up a level "/../" or "../" (we can do this multiple times) 
            and even add folders after ../ to open another folder that level up
        - 3. linked page in sub directory - need to move down a level, so list the subdirectory name

<p>hello, world</p> - <p> = opening tag, "hello, world = content, </p> = closing tag

content is simply that

tags are opening and closing 

forgetting to close an element with a closing tag or forgetting forward / is a classic mistake

we can nest elements within eath other ie <p>Hello, <em> World</em></p>
be sure to close elements in same order you open them, close the innermost loop first

types of elements 
    - block-level elements form a visible block on the page, they start a new line and are generally the structural elements ofthe page ie <p>
    - in line elements - contained within block-level elements and dont create new lines and are typically used to modify specific bites of content ie <em> (it italics)

nesting is a big part of html, ie head holds meta and title element

<!DOCTYPE html> = necessary for all html files

html element  - wraps all of the content on this page, root element, highest and outermost element

head element contains all the meta information about this page

<meta charset = "utf-8"> specifies the characters works for most human languages

<title></title> sets title of page in brower tag

<body></body> contains all the content that displays on the page

<strong>SHORTCUT FOR FIRST TEN LINES OF CODE = ! + ENTER</strong>
creates this below...

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
