This repo is for ATLAS Web class.
My name is Ari Guzzi, and I am a CTD major CS minor.
I am very interested in front end software design, I have taught myself some HTML and CSS to make a website for my portfolio. It's not super pretty or perfect, but its a start. I am interested in learning about mobile app developemt as a CTD major.

I grew up in Boulder, Colorado. I went to Tulane University freshman and half of sophmore year. I then took a year off for mental health and then started at CU Boulder. I switched from CS major to CTD last semester.

My funfact about myself is that I love gardening and am very interested in medicinal herbs. I love apothecaries!
